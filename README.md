  *   Example project of displaying a 360 image in a sphere in Vizard<https://www.dropbox.com/s/373q5gsijewc936/mars_curiosity.zip?dl=0>
     *   By the way, if you need to create 360 photos, PT GUI<https://www.ptgui.com/> is the tool we used to create the Mars panoramas
     *   The projection used for displaying a 360 photo on a sphere is called the equirectangular projection.
     *   The size of images for that are typically 2:1 width to height ratio.  You typically want to chose a power of 2 when trying different sizes (ex. 2048x1024, 4096x2048â€¦ etc.)
